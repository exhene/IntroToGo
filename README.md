# IntroToGo

Go is an open-source programming language that was developed at Google in 2007. It is designed to be efficient, reliable, and scalable, with a focus on simplicity and ease of use. Go is often used for building web servers, network tools, and other applications that require high concurrency and performance. It is a statically typed language that supports garbage collection, and includes features such as first-class functions, slices, and maps. Go also includes built-in support for concurrent programming through its "go routines" and "channels" features, which enable efficient communication and synchronization between different parts of a program. Go's popularity has been on the rise in recent years, with many companies and developers adopting it for its speed, simplicity, and versatility.
